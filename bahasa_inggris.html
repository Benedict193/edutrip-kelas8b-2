            <p>Di Bahasa Inggris, I will learn about the Kuo Sheng Nuclear Powerplant</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>Do you know where your electricity comes from? What about Taiwan's electricity? 
                This article is here to tell you the truth about where the light in your home comes from, 
                where our airfryer gets power and much more. But to get a heads up, Taiwan's  electricity mostly comes from power plant</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <img src="20250311_134407.jpg" alt="Kuo Sheng Nuclear Powerplant viewport">
            <p>First, how does it work? It works by uranium 235 getting “shot” by neutrons. 
                This makes a chain reaction of heat and this heat is transferred to the water above it. 
                This chain reaction is called nuclear fission. 
                The heat is then captured and converted by a turbine that converts the heat into electricity. 
                Since the heat is so massive from the nuclear fission, 
                it's a really good way to generate power or electricity. At the bottom of the “stove”, 
                there are cooling rods used to keep the temperature stable and safe to contain.</p>

        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <img class="small-img" src="Robot Nigga.jpeg" alt="Robot">
            <p>Since you now know how the power plant generates electricity, 
                I will now tell you the risks of running a power plant. 
                As uncle Ben once said “with great power, comes great responsibility”. 
                In terms of context, this actually makes sense because there are risks that we have to take, 
                there are only a few risks, but if one of these things happens, bad things can occur. 
                The first risk is a nuclear meltdown, since the nuclear item and the water is extremely hot, 
                this can melt its container which spills radioactive waste in the surrounding area and even cause an explosion. 
                This tragedy actually happened on April 26, 1986 or the Chernobyl Incident, 
                to this day the place still has a small amount of radioactivity, 
                that's almost 50 years after the initial tragedy. This incident also involves a breach and a malfunction, 
                more specifically the cooling rods malfunction which is used to control the temperature,
                but since it malfunctioned, the water and the nuclear material got too hot for the container to handle.
            </p>

            <p>Since now you know there are risks and what the risks are, 
                how do they prevent an accident from ever happening? The nuclear power plant has many workers, 
                these workers are very educated and professionals on handling a situation. To help them, 
                there are signal warnings that will alert the workers if a machine/component is damaged or has
                 malfunctioned, after that, a crew will fix the problem. Another safety measure that they do is 
                 by replacing the water and the nuclear material every 1 and a half years or 18 months. 
                 These safety measurements ensure the safety of the surrounding area and the power plant itself.</p>

            <p>To sum it all up, the nuclear power plant is one of Taiwan's main
                 sources of electricity and it works by harnessing heat from nuclear material. 
                 The power plant is very dangerous but is handled by professionals. 
                 Safety measures such as yearly checking and alarms have been placed to minimize 
                 the possibility of an accident. It is a very good tourist are who wants to learn 
                 about how nuclear power plants work in more detail and since its made just by the sea, 
                 you can get a stunningly beautiful view. Nuclear power is the future of technology and 
                 we have used it to help us in our lives, this can be a massive advancement for human kind, 
                 because this can open up many opportunities to see what we can harness next.</p>
